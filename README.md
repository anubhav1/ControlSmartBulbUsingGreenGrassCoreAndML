# ControlSmartBulbUsingGreenGrassCoreAndML
This projects allow someone to control smartbulb from Yeelight using their own handwritten commands. An IoT thing takes picture of handwritten command and send it to greengrass group where
a ML model predicts the word from that handwritten command and sends that command to smart bulb.
